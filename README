Description:

xiv is a very simple image viewer without UI and only controled by keys and mouse.
As opposed to most of the image viewers, it does not rely on scrollbar for image panning.
It is a powerful tool to analyse huge images.
The Window is a view of the image in which you can zoom, pan, rotate...
xiv reads natively 8 and 16 bits binary PPM and TIFF and JPEG images. It uses ImageMagick to convert other formats.
Image drawing is performed in several threads for a better image analysis experience.
Next image is preloaded during current image analysis.
See usage for the full list of features.

xiv comes with an additional script xiv.sh which will open a file
selection box if called without any file. File selection box requires
kdialog (KDE), zenity (GNOME) or Xdialog. This script is meant to use
xiv from a desktop environment.

Points input:
   You can set up to 10 points using keys F1 to F10. If points are displayed (which is the default) you'll see them on top of the image.
   At the end of the image viewing, the points are written to stdout (before switching to another image or quitting).

  xiv -browse /images/image1.jpg: opens images1.jpg as well as every files in the /images directory.
  xiv -shuffle /images/*: opens every files in /images in random order.
