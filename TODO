Liquid Galaxy version:
----------------------
* Fix all the hanging that happens on slaves, or when using the spacenav
* Make xiv complain when it gets command line options it doesn't understand.
  Right now it thinks they're image names. Perhaps it's best to complain when
  it gets an image name it can't find a file for.

Original version:
-----------------
Better read_tiff function (Tile,...).
Better gamma correction.
Add title to kdialog/Xdialog.
Customizable shortcuts.
Improve cache and preload.
Recursive search + skip to next directory.
